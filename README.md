# Shrek Avatar Recovery System (S.A.R.S)

S.A.R.S is an avatar recovery tool! It is only for educational uses! We do not condone theft of avatars, the tool soley exists to recover avatars from within VRChat back onto new accounts and into their unity packages keeping as much of the avatar in-tact as possible!

Thx to [nesrak1](https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET) for the original "AssetTools.NET.dll" file that was edited by FACS01 and then packed into our HOTSWAP allowing for VRCA files to be compressed and decompressed!

Thx to [FACS01](https://github.com/FACS01-01/FACS_Utilities) for the bledshape and animation repairs only compatable with VRCA files extracted with S.A.R.S & scanning of the Unity Packages!

Thx to Keafy for reuploader login code in which the new login code was driven from
